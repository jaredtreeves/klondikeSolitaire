klondikeSolitaire
=================

This is a primitive version of Klondike Solitaire. In this
version the cards drag, however there is some slight shifting of the card on 
the inituial click. All the remain logic is working correctly.

If the stock pile is clicked the waste gets the top card and is flipped. It
can move throughout the stockpile until it is empty and then the stock is
reset. If the foundation piles can take a card it will, as does all the
tableau piles. If the piles cannot take the card or pile the card or pile is
returned to the original position.

later versions will include menu that will have new game functionality as well 
as other features.
